All asymmetrical pairs have the secondary space-padded\nform.\n\nFor example:\n\n`s )`\n\n```\nHello world -> (Hello world)\n```\n\n`s (`\n\n```\nHello world -> ( Hello world )\n```\n\nCurrently, the following pairs work out of the box!:\n\n- ()\n- []\n- {}\n- \"\"\n- ''\n\nYou can add to the available pairs in atom's settings, and the commands will\nbe dynamically added to your keybindings.\n\nFor example if I wanted to add the pair '/\\', I would add this in my settings:\n\n```\n(), [], {}, \"\", '', /\\\n```\n\nThen:\n\n`s \\`\n\n```\nHello world -> /Hello world\\\n```\n\n`s /`\n\n```\nHello world -> / Hello world \\\n```\n\n### TODO\n\n- [ ] Implement changing surrounding pairs with `c s`\n- [ ] Implement deleting surrounding pairs with `d s`\n- [ ] Intelligent tag surrounding/deleting/replacing with `s <q>` and friends.\n",
